# HIVE Lab
The HIVE Lab group is involved in developing the [High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE)](https://github.com/FDA/fda-hive) which is a collaborative project between a group at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Dr. Raja Mazumder's [HIVE Lab](https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/home) team at George Washington University (GW). Both groups are coordinating their efforts to integrate various high throughput data analysis tools into the HIVE platform. In addition to the HIVE platform, HIVE Lab is involved in developing standards for bioinformatics communication (BioCompute), and knowledgebases in glycoinformatics (GlyGen), cancer research (OncoMX, [BioMuta](https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/biomuta/about), [BioXpress](https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/biomuta/about)) and [microbiome analysis](https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/gfkb).
